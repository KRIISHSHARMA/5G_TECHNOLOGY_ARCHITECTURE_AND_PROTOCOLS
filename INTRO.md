## standardization of 5G 
- ITR-R (international telecommunication union - radiocommunication) responsible to develop 5G requirements
- technical specification developped by 3GPP
- 3GPP is a consortium of major telecom vendors and operators
- ITU-R requirements ==> 3GPP techincal specifications ==> vendors take specifications to develop their equipments so thier equipments can operate with one one another in harmony
